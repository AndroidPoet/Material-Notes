## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
- Jetpack
  - Lifecycle - Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel - Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - DataBinding - Binds UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
  - Room Persistence - Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (View - DataBinding - ViewModel - Model)

  - Repository Pattern
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - A logger with a small, extensible API.
- [Material-Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Material design components for building ripple animation, and CardView.



## Architecture
Material-Notes is based on the MVVM architecture and the Repository pattern.
